<H1>Image Resizer</H2>
<H3>Christian Aranda</H3>

The purpouse of this programi is to resize images in bulk and create a folder to store the resized images.

Other paid programs like Photoshop and Illustrator can do the same procedure, but this is mainly for those who don't have an Adobe license.

Task:
This program will resizer all images in specified location and createa folder titled "resized_imgs" in the folder before the specified folder.

Edit:
The main place in the program where you can change the location of the imgs is going to be in the variable "img_loc"

There are fields where you can change the size in the code.
The variable "fixed_height" is the main variable that is going to effect the images that you resize.
